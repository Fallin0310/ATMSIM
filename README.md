# ATM System Project  

## Overview  
This project is a Java-based ATM simulation system designed to demonstrate core programming concepts and practical application skills. The system provides functionalities like user authentication, balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and fund transfers in a secure and efficient manner.  

## Features  
- **User Authentication**: Ensures only authorized users can access their accounts.  
- **Balance Inquiry**: Allows users to check their current account balance.  
- **Cash Withdrawal**: Facilitates withdrawal of specified amounts, ensuring sufficient balance.  
- **Deposit**: Enables users to add money to their accounts.  
- **Fund Transfer**: Allows secure transfer of funds between accounts.  
- **Transaction Logs**: Records transactions for future reference and auditing.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Java (Core Java concepts)  
- **Database**: MySQL (for storing user data and transaction records)  
- **Frameworks**: JDBC for database connectivity  
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub
